COTD: Cat of the Day

php web application using JQuery Mobile that publishes a list of ordered items. 
Each item has an image and trivia associated with it.
Cats are used as a default sample list, but lists of abritary items and length can be used.

# Website

A sample running application is hosted on OpenShift Online V2.

    http://www.cotd.net.au

# Configuration

Lists can be customed by editing the contents in the data subdirectory.
Edit selector.php to point to subdirectory name of the list of interest.
Edit the rank.php file under the subdirectory of the selected list.
Add images as required in the images subdirectory with names matching list items.

# Logging

Whenever the user rates an item, an entry is written to the php log.
These entries can be filtered and then used to test hypotheses regarding user engagement.
An example entry is as follows:

    [Sun Sep 25 09:14:40.037909 2016] [:error] [pid 15] [client 172.17.0.1:46572] <COTD> { "user" : "e299ra835usa88pp19sr25ipg6", items" : [ {"adelaide" : "1"}, {"canberra" : "3"}, ] , "client_ip" : "172.17.0.1",  "sydney_time" : "2016:09:25 19:14:40",  } </COTD>, referer: http://localhost:8080/item.php?nextpage=canberra

# AB Deployment Example

To demonstrate AB deployments try the following:

## Setup Environment
Fork this Git repo
Visit https://www.openshift.org/vm/ to create an instance of OpenShift 

## Create Project
Visit the Console at https://10.2.2.2:8443/console/ using credentials user/user
Create a project called cotd with description "Cat of the Day"

    oc new-project cotd --display-name="City of the day" --description='City of the day'

## Create A Application
Visit your Git repo and change the data/selector.php to point to "cats"
Create a php application called cotd1 and point it to this Git repo
Verify that the application using http://cotd1-cotd.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io

    oc new-app openshift/php:5.6~https://github.com/eformat/cotd.git#master --name=master

## Create B Application
Visit your Git repo and change the data/selector.php to point to "cities"
Create a php application called cotd2 and point it to this Git repo
Verify that the application using http://cotd2-cotd.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io

    oc new-app openshift/php:5.6~https://github.com/eformat/cotd.git#feature --name=feature

## Create AB Route Target
Switch to the Applications > Routes tab in the Console
Create a route ab pointing to http://ab-cotd.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io

    oc expose service master --hostname=cotd.192.168.137.2.xip.io --name=cotd

## Change route policy to round robin
By default the HA proxy router will configure your route for least connection.
To work correctly with weights, set an annotation so that round robin balancing is used

    oc annotate route/cotd haproxy.router.openshift.io/balance=roundrobin

## Create AB Routing Rule
From a terminal window issue an $ oc login https://10.2.2.2:8443 with credentials user/user 
Set the project to cotd using $ oc project cotd
Create a AB route using the web UI - broswe to cotd Route
RouteSplit traffic across multiple services
Verify the AB 50/50 setting in the cotd project

    oc set route-backends routes/cotd master=50 feature=50

You can also incrementally adjust from client

    oc set route-backends routes/cotd --adjust feature=+10%

## Verify AB Behavior
Launch a a different browser and set cookies preferences to "never allow"
Open http://ab-cotd.apps.10.2.2.2.xip.io 
Refresh and note changes between cats and cities versions


# Running using Docker Toolbox

    $ docker pull spicozzi/cotd
    $ docker run -d -i -p 8080:80 spicozzi/cotd
    Browser http://localhost:8080

# Running on Openshift3

    oc new-project cotd --display-name="City of the day" --description='City of the day'
    oc new-app openshift/php:5.6~https://github.com/<repo>/cotd.git
    oc expose svc cotd

# Developing on the fly in Openshift3

Edit the buildconfig:

    -- change from Git to binary
    source:
      type: Git
      git:
        uri: 'https://github.com/eformat/cotd.git'
      secrets: null

    -- to this
    source:
      type: Binary

    -- then build with
    oc start-build --from-dir=. cotd

You may also wish to enable live reload for php image (don't do this in prod)

    oc set env dc/cotd OPCACHE_REVALIDATE_FREQ=0

# Parse the pods running statistics

For now:

    ./parseCotdLogs.pl $(oc get pods | grep cotd | grep Running | awk '{print $1}')
